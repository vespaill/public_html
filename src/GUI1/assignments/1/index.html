                Full-stack web development involves working on both the
                front-end and back-end portions of an application. The front-end
                is what user will see or interact with. Back-end is more of the
                logic and server side. Full-stack web developers need to learn
                many languages and concepts, including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a
                back-end language like SQL, databases and web storage, the HTTP
                internet protocol, the web application architecture, Git version
                control, and lastly, basic algorithms and data structures.

                HTML allows one add content to a website. CSS allows one to
                style the content. Some important topics include Semantic HTML,
                the CSS Box Model, CSS preprocessors, CSS Media Queries and
                Bootstrap.
            </p>

            <p>
                Semantic HTML involves the use of HTML elements to give meaning
                to a webpage rather than just for presentation. Doing so
                facilitates communication between the contents of a website and
                a search engine.

                The CSS box model is a rectangular box that the browser uses to
                represent HTML elements. The CSS code determines the box’s size,
                position, and many other properties such as background color and
                border size. Each box is composed of four parts: the content
                edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.
            </p>

            <p>
                CSS Pre-processors are scripting languages that extend the
                default capabilities of CSS. They enable the use of logic,
                variables, nesting, inheritance, mixins, functions, and
                mathematical operations. Thus, they facilitate the writing of
                reusable, maintainable and extensible CSS code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Media queries allow CSS code to check the device’s capabilities
                in order to deliver a tailored experience. For example, they can
                be used to check for the device’s width and height, its
                orientation and the screen resolution. With this information one
                can alter elements to deliver a better experience on a specific
                device.

                Bootstrap is one of many frameworks used to help design and
                layout content on a website. JavaScript is the only language
                that runs natively in any browser. It can also be used as a
                server-side language.

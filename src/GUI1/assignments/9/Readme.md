I believe I implemented all required functionality:

- Letter tiles in the player's "hand" are selected randomly from a data
  structure with the proper distribution of the letters.
- Letter tiles can be dragged-and-dropped onto target Scrabble squares.
- Program identifies which letter tile is dropped onto which Scrabble square.
- Board includes bonus squares.
- Score is tallied correctly, including consideration of bonus square multiplier
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Any number of words can be played until the player wishes to quit.
- The board is cleared after each round so that a new word can be played.
- After playing a word, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring the
  player's "hand" back to 7 tiles are selected.
- score is kept for multiple words.
